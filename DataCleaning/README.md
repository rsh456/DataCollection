## Data Cleaning
The first step in any data science project is cleaning data.
Handling missing data, inconsistencies and duplicate records.
* Faceting: Break your data up into smaller buckets that are easy to work with.
* Atomization: Splittig multi-value cells into separate cells.
* Clustering: A technique which groups similar data.
